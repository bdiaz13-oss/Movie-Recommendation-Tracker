This Flask-based web application serves as a personal dashboard for tracking movie and TV show recommendations. Users can add, edit, view, and delete entries with details like title, rating, genres, watched date, platform, and reviews (supporting markdown). It features a responsive dashboard with paginated cards, genre management, search functionality, and visual elements like poster images and star ratings, all stored in a simple JSON file for easy persistence without a database.

I developed this app with assistance from Generative AI (Grok by xAI), which generated the initial code structure, templates, and routes based on my prompts. AI also helped debug errors (JSON decoding, template not found, etc.), refine UX elements like form disclosures and field clarifications, and suggest improvements such as dynamic genre addition via JavaScript, ensuring a clean, deployable project.
